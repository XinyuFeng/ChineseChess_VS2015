A powerful chess which can defeat most of people

The rules are pruned from wiki : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiangqi

R: Rooks move and capture any distance orthogonally, but may not jump over intervening pieces. The chariots begin the game on the points at the corners of the board. The rook is often considered to be the strongest piece in the game due to its freedom of movement and lack of restrictions.

H: Horses begin the game next to the elephants, on their outside flanks. A horse moves and captures one point orthogonally and then one point diagonally away from its former position, a move which is traditionally described as being like the character 日 Rì. The horse does not jump as the knight does in Western chess, and can be blocked by a piece located one point horizontally or vertically adjacent to it. Blocking a horse is called "hobbling the horse's leg" (蹩馬腿). The diagram on the left illustrates the horse's movement. 

E:Elephants are located next to the bishops. These pieces move and capture exactly two points diagonally and may not jump over intervening pieces; the move is described as being like the character 田 Tián ("field"). If an elephant cannot move due to a diagonally adjacent piece, it is known as "blocking the elephant's eye" (塞象眼). Elephants may not cross the river, and serve as defensive pieces. Because an elephant's movement is restricted to just seven board positions, it can be easily trapped or threatened. The two elephants are often used to defend each other.

B:Bishops start on either side of the king. They move and capture one point diagonally and may not leave the palace, which confines them to five points on the board. The bishop is probably derived from the mantri in chaturanga, like the queen in Western chess.

K:starts the game at the midpoint of the back edge, within the palace. The king may move and capture one point orthogonally, with the following exception. The two kings may not face each other along the same file with no intervening pieces. If that happens, the 飛將 ("flying king") move may be executed, in which the king to move may cross the board to capture the enemy king. In practice, this rule is only used to enforce checkmate. The king may not leave the palace except when executing the flying king move.

C:Each player has two cannons, which start on the row behind the soldiers, two points in front of the horses. Cannons move like chariots, any distance orthogonally without jumping, but can only capture by jumping a single piece, friend or foe, along the path of attack. The piece over which the cannon jumps is called the 炮臺 (trad.) / 炮台 (simp.) pào tái ("cannon platform") or "screen". Any number of unoccupied spaces, including none, may exist between the cannon, screen, and the piece to be captured. Cannons can be exchanged for horses immediately from their starting positions.

P:Each side has five soldiers. Soldiers begin the game located on every other point one row back from the edge of the river. They move and capture by advancing one point. Once they have crossed the river, they may also move and capture one point horizontally. Soldiers cannot move backward, and therefore cannot retreat; after advancing to the last rank of the board, however, a soldier may still move sideways at the enemy's edge. The soldier is sometimes called the "pawn" by English-speaking players, due to the pieces' similarities.
